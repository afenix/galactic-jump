You have come close enough to see that the red thing is no pile, so you turn
your attention to the pink pile. Yare overcome by the sensation of feeling home
for the first time since the tube sucked you in. There is an obstacle that
seems to surround the small pink pile. It is not tall though and you can easily
climb over it and dive in on top of the pile. You suckle your new friends with
wild abandon and they taste amazing!!! Very quickly however, you notice that your
new friends have dissapeared. They did taste amazing... perhaps they stopped
flurping so you could suck them in? You will most certainly see them again some
day.

The ground in this area does not taste quite as good, so it is time to move on.
A new thing has come into view behind where the little pink pile was. You don't
have words for it, because it is not a pile, and it is not a flurp. At the same
time you yearn to go home. Perhaps, if you return to where you arrived in this
strange place, the giant sucking tube thingy will come back and take you home.
